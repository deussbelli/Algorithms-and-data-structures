## Overview
**Algorithms and Data Structures** is a comprehensive collection of fundamental algorithms and data structure implementations written in C++. This repository is designed for those looking to explore, understand, and test various algorithms, enhancing their problem-solving and coding skills.

## Implemented Algorithms and Data Structures
This repository includes the following implementations:

- **AVL Tree**: A self-balancing binary search tree that maintains balance to ensure efficient operations.
- **Markov Algorithm**: An algorithmic approach for transformations and string manipulations.
- **Bit Set**: A data structure that handles sets of bits and supports operations like insertion, deletion, and membership testing.
- **Graphs (Dijkstra's Algorithm)**: An implementation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm for finding the shortest path in weighted graphs.
- **Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)**: Algorithms for converting and evaluating expressions using Reverse Polish Notation.
- **Arrays (Shell Sort)**: Implementation of the Shell sort algorithm for sorting arrays.
- **Matrix Methods (Algebra and Geometry)**: Matrix operations involving algebraic and geometric transformations.
- **Polish Notation**: Algorithms for converting and evaluating expressions using Polish notation.
- **Sparse Matrix**: Implementation of a data structure for storing matrices with a majority of zero elements efficiently.
- **Stack**: A basic data structure implementation with standard operations (push, pop, peek).
- **Table**: A simple table data structure for storing key-value pairs.
- **Hash Table**: An implementation of a hash table supporting efficient data retrieval.
- **Queue**: A basic implementation of a queue data structure with standard enqueue and dequeue operations.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Another instance of the shortest path algorithm implemented for graph analysis.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deussbelli/Algorithms-and-data-structures.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd Algorithms-and-data-structures
3. Compile and run the C++ files using your preferred C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang).

## Usage
Each algorithm and data structure is contained in its own directory with source code and, in some cases, testing code to verify correctness. To use or test a specific algorithm, navigate to the corresponding directory and compile the relevant C++ file.

**Example:**
  ```bash
g++ avl_tree.cpp -o avl_tree
./avl_tree
